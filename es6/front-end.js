// Backend - Node + Express API => JSON data, JSON will be consumed on front end
// localhost:9000/api/user/signinup => userid/{userInfo}

// Express -- is a webserver that is responsible to host the application as it handles modules(?), etc. 
// other servers: tomcat apache, etc.
// Express the node modules to give the connections and to host the API
// Webpack-dev-server --> webpack - core module, dev-server - is for the server(?)

// Frontend -- React, lightweight-library
// endpoints where application will be hosted 
// localhost:9090/home
// localhost:9090/login
// localhost:9090/about
// header + footer

// Webpack-dev-server --> webpack - core module, dev-server - is for the server(?)

// Webpack 
// -- used as build and configuration tool ((check pptx)) as it is a module bundler not a task runner
// -- is a tool used for development 

// 1. Bundling of multiple files generated for different screens(creates a new bundle of all component.js)
// ==> each file will be bundled into bundle.js
// e.g. --> home.js login.js, etc. into bundle.js 
// 2. Minification of files --> removing spaces, changing smart logical replacements, removing commented codes, redundant codes --> for performance-benefit

// let stmt = "2.minification of files"
// stmt stmt stmt stmt
// stmt stmt stmt
// stmt stmt stmt

// 3. Minification of files can be done by js, jsx(react file), css, images, etc.
// 4. Transpilation using Babel loaders --> converting code written in ES6/7/8/next,react into core javascript
// browsers will not be able to understand the codes written with es6, react, etc. and will only be able to process core js, css, etc.(?)
// creating multiple versions of application vs one version of application

// 5. Support for developers to debug by having multiple versions for production support
// 6. Monitoring, rebuilding, and hot-reloading of application with changes on the fly
